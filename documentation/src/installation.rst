============
Installation
============

This page describes how to get started with GORpipe.

Prerequisites
=============

Before setting up GORpipe the following need to be installed:

* Java JDK or JRE version 8 or higher (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
* Open JDK can also be used (https://openjdk.java.net/install/)
* Gradle (https://gradle.org/install/)

Setting up test data
====================

Test data for GOR is obtained by cloning the GOR test data repository (https://github.com/gorpipe/gor-test-data) as a submodule into the tests/data folder:

.. code-block:: bash

    git submodule update --init --recursive

Getting started with GORPipe
============================

To get started with GORPipe, compile the code:

.. code-block:: bash

     make build

Now gor queries can been run against test data. For example via:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./gortools/build/install/gor-scripts/bin/gorpipe "gor tests/data/gor/dbsnp_test.gor | top 10"

The results should be as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    Chrom   POS     reference       allele  differentrsIDs
    chr1    10179   C       CC      rs367896724
    chr1    10250   A       C       rs199706086
    chr10   60803   T       G       rs536478188
    chr10   61023   C       G       rs370414480
    chr11   61248   G       A       rs367559610
    chr11   66295   C       A       rs61869613
    chr12   60162   C       G       rs544101329
    chr12   60545   A       T       rs570991495
    chr13   19020013        C       T       rs181615907
    chr13   19020145        G       T       rs28970552

Setting up GOR shell
====================

GORpipe can be invoked and used through an interactive shell session in a terminal - a sort of REPL for GOR, coined GORshell. Start a GORshell by executing:

.. code-block:: bash

    tools/build/install/tools/bin/gorshell

This will start an interactive shell session where queries can be executed:

.. code-block:: gor

    gor tests/data/gor/dbsnp_test.gor | top 10

For a list of GOR input sources, pipe commands and other details, simply type help within the GOR shell.

Running GOR without setting up the test data submodule can be done by generating GOR rows and then running GOR against that data. For example:

.. code-block:: gor

    gor <(gorrows -p chr1:1000-20000 -segment 100 -step 50 | multimap -cartesian <(norrows 100 | group -lis -sc #1))

Setting environment variables
-----------------------------

For convenience, GORpipe and GORshell can be added to path. For example on Mac by editing /etc/paths:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo vim /etc/paths

and add the following lines:

.. code-block:: bash

    <PATH_TO_GOR_REPO>/gortools/build/install/gor-scripts/bin
    <PATH_TO_GOR_REPO>/tools/build/install/tools/bin/gorshell


Then GORpipe and GORshell can be started via `gorpipe` and `gorshell` from any location.
