## Introduction

The GORpipe analysis tool is developed and released by WuXi NextCODE Genomics. It originates from the pioneers of population based genomic analysis, deCODE genetics, headquartered in Reykjavik, Iceland.
        
GORpipe is a tool based on a genomic ordered relational architecture and allows analysis of large sets of genomic and phenotypic tabular data using a declarative query language, in a parallel execution engine.  It is very efficient in a wide range of use-cases, including genome wide batch analysis, range-queries, genomic table joins of variants and segments, filtering, aggregation etc.  The query language combines ideas from SQL and Unix shell pipe syntax, supporting seek-able nested queries, materialized views, and a rich set of commands and functions.  For more information see the paper in Bioinformatics (https://dx.doi.org/10.1093%2Fbioinformatics%2Fbtw199).

## Prerequisites

Before setting up GORpipe you need to have Java set up on your computer:

* Java JDK or JRE version 8 or higher (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
* Open JDK can also be used (https://openjdk.java.net/install/)
    
## Setting up Test Data

Test data for GOR is obtained by cloning the GOR test data repository (https://github.com/gorpipe/gor-test-data) as a submodule into the `tests/data` folder:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

## Getting Started With GORpipe

To get started with GORpipe, compile the code:

     make build
         
Now gor queries can been run against test data. For example:

    ./gortools/build/install/gor-scripts/bin/gorpipe "gor tests/data/gor/dbsnp_test.gor | top 10"

The results should be as follows:

    Chrom   POS     reference       allele  differentrsIDs
    chr1    10179   C       CC      rs367896724
    chr1    10250   A       C       rs199706086
    chr10   60803   T       G       rs536478188
    chr10   61023   C       G       rs370414480
    chr11   61248   G       A       rs367559610
    chr11   66295   C       A       rs61869613
    chr12   60162   C       G       rs544101329
    chr12   60545   A       T       rs570991495
    chr13   19020013        C       T       rs181615907
    chr13   19020145        G       T       rs28970552

## Setting up an Interactive Shell for GORpipe

GORpipe can be invoked and used through an interactive shell session in a terminal - a sort of REPL for GOR, coined GORshell. Start a GORshell by executing:

    tools/build/install/tools/bin/gorshell   
    
This will start an interactive shell session where queries can be executed:

    gor tests/data/gor/dbsnp_test.gor | top 10
        
For a list of GOR input sources, pipe commands and other details, simply type `help` within the GOR shell.

Running GOR without setting up the test data submodule can be done by generating GOR rows and then running GOR against that data. For example:

    gor <(gorrows -p chr1:1000-20000 -segment 100 -step 50 | multimap -cartesian <(norrows 100 | group -lis -sc #1))

## Add to Path

For convenience, GORpipe and GORshell can be added to path. For example on Mac by editing /etc/paths: 

    sudo vim /etc/paths 
    
... and add the following lines: 

    <PATH_TO_GOR_REPO>/gortools/build/install/gor-scripts/bin
    <PATH_TO_GOR_REPO>/tools/build/install/tools/bin/gorshell 

Then GORpipe and GORshell can be started via `gorpipe` and `gorshell` from any location.
